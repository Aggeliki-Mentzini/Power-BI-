Diagnostic analytics
Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened. Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events. Then, performance indicators are further investigated to discover why these events improved or became worse. Generally, this process occurs in three steps:

* Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.

* Collect data that's related to these anomalies.

* Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.
